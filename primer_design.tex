\title{Protocol: Designing DNA-Primers for PCR}
\author{Jack Reddan}

\maketitle{}

\tableofcontents{}

\section{Purpose}
This protocol is intended for those wanting to design DNA oligomers to be used as primers for PCR.
This protocol will not describe how to identify the sequence you wish to amplify,
since this is variable depending on what you wish to accomplish.
Therefore, a prerequisite for this protocol is to already have a target sequence in mind.
